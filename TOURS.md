# Tours

## Contributing

If you'd like to create a new tour or add/edit any of the existing tours, but don't know how to set up a development environment, please feel free to describe it in whatever way works for you. Show what you think should be highlighted, how it should be explained, etc. in whatever way you want.

Draw it in GIMP, sketch it on paper and take a picture, as long as you can show it to us! Send all your ideas to [@Community](https://tildes.net/user/Community/new_message) and we'll take care of the beeps and boops to get it into the WebExtension. Thank you!

## Completion Status

Below is a rough list of the planned tours together with which version of the WebExtension the tour is available in. Names and organization will likely change and differ from what's shown in the options page.

If a tour is checked and has a version number it's available from Mozilla Addons right now. If it is checked and doesn't have a version number it's finished but hasn't yet been published. And if it's unchecked it hasn't been finished yet.
